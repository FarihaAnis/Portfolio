## Projects
[Project 1: FIFA21 Data Cleaning & EDA](https://github.com/FarihaAnis/Portfolio/blob/main/FIFA21%20Data%20Cleaning%20%26%20EDA.ipynb)

The FIFA21 dataset, sourced from Kaggle, provides comprehensive player information from the FIFA series soccer simulation video game released by Electronic Arts in October 2020. With data on 18,980 players and 77 attributes including player ID, age, nationality, club affiliation, and performance metrics, this dataset serves as a valuable resource for in-depth analysis. In this project, I will conduct an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) focusing on various data types, address issues like missing data and outliers, and perform necessary data preprocessing steps to unlock valuable insights within the virtual soccer world of FIFA21.

[Project 2: Classification Models for Predicting FIFA 21 Players' Overall Ratings (OVA)](https://github.com/FarihaAnis/Portfolio/blob/main/Classification%20Models%20for%20Predicting%20FIFA%2021%20Players'%20Overall%20Ratings%20(OVA).ipynb)

This classification project aims to categorize FIFA21 players into their Overall (OVA) categories using machine learning techniques. The project involves the exploration of three different classification models: Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Gaussian Naive Bayes. Through a rigorous process of hyperparameter tuning and evaluation, the study compares the effectiveness of manual tuning, guided by domain knowledge, with grid search methods across these models. Additionally, the project incorporates K-fold cross-validation to assess model robustness and select the optimal K-fold value. The findings highlight the significance of hyperparameter selection and model evaluation techniques in achieving accurate classification results, offering insights into the trade-offs between manual and automated tuning approaches in different model contexts.

[Project 3: Statistical-based Forecasting Model](https://github.com/FarihaAnis/Portfolio/blob/main/Statistical-based%20Forecasting%20Model%20.ipynb)

This project focuses on analyzing and forecasting Malaysia's Consumer Price Index (CPI) dataset spanning from 1980 to 2005. The CPI dataset serves as a crucial economic indicator, reflecting changes in the cost of living and inflation over time. Through meticulous data preparation, including handling missing values and transforming columns, the dataset is prepared for analysis. Feature selection based on autocorrelation analysis identifies the primary variables of interest, namely the 'Year' and 'Total' CPI columns. Subsequently, stationary tests are conducted, and the data is transformed to ensure its suitability for modeling. Two forecasting models are developed: an Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network model. The performance of these models is evaluated, with the LSTM model demonstrating superior forecasting accuracy. This project highlights the effectiveness of both traditional statistical methods and advanced deep learning techniques in forecasting CPI trends, offering insights valuable for economic planning and policy-making in Malaysia.

[Project 4: Association Rule Mining](https://github.com/FarihaAnis/Portfolio/blob/main/Association%20Rule%20Mining.ipynb)

This project analyzes Dataset A, containing daily store transactions including member numbers, dates, and items purchased. After thorough exploration and preparation for association rule mining, key insights like top-selling items and transaction trends are revealed. Leveraging the Apriori algorithm, association rules are generated based on frequent itemsets, with recommendations provided to optimize sales and customer satisfaction by strategically positioning related items within the store layout.
