## Projects
[Project 1: FIFA21 Data Preproceesing & EDA, Tools: Python](https://github.com/FarihaAnis/Portfolio/blob/main/FIFA21%20Data%20Preprocessing%20&%20EDA.ipynb)

Delving into the FIFA21 dataset sourced from Kaggle, this project explores a comprehensive repository of player attributes from the popular soccer simulation video game released by Electronic Arts. With information on nearly 19,000 players encompassing various demographics, performance metrics, and in-game statistics, the objective is to perform comprehensive data preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Through meticulous handling of missing values, outlier detection, data encoding, and numerical and categorical analysis, the aim is to unlock valuable insights into player characteristics, distribution patterns, and factors influencing gameplay dynamics. By scrutinizing the dataset's intricacies, the goal is to provide a holistic understanding of the virtual soccer world depicted in FIFA21, facilitating informed decisions and further exploration in the realm of sports analytics.

[Project 2: Classification Models for Predicting FIFA 21 Players' Overall Ratings (OVA), Tools: Python](https://github.com/FarihaAnis/Portfolio/blob/main/Classification%20Models%20for%20Predicting%20FIFA%2021%20Players'%20Overall%20Ratings%20(OVA).ipynb)

This classification project aims to categorize FIFA21 players into their Overall (OVA) categories using machine learning techniques. The project involves the exploration of three different classification models: Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Gaussian Naive Bayes. Through a rigorous process of hyperparameter tuning and evaluation, the study compares the effectiveness of manual tuning, guided by domain knowledge, with grid search methods across these models. Additionally, the project incorporates K-fold cross-validation to assess model robustness and select the optimal K-fold value. The findings highlight the significance of hyperparameter selection and model evaluation techniques in achieving accurate classification results, offering insights into the trade-offs between manual and automated tuning approaches in different model contexts.

[Project 3: Statistical-based Forecasting Model, Tools: Python](https://github.com/FarihaAnis/Portfolio/blob/main/Statistical-based%20Forecasting%20Model%20.ipynb)

This project focuses on analyzing and forecasting Malaysia's Consumer Price Index (CPI) dataset spanning from 1980 to 2005. The CPI dataset serves as a crucial economic indicator, reflecting changes in the cost of living and inflation over time. Through meticulous data preparation, including handling missing values and transforming columns, the dataset is prepared for analysis. Feature selection based on autocorrelation analysis identifies the primary variables of interest, namely the 'Year' and 'Total' CPI columns. Subsequently, stationary tests are conducted, and the data is transformed to ensure its suitability for modeling. Two forecasting models are developed: an Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network model. The performance of these models is evaluated, with the LSTM model demonstrating superior forecasting accuracy. This project highlights the effectiveness of both traditional statistical methods and advanced deep learning techniques in forecasting CPI trends, offering insights valuable for economic planning and policy-making in Malaysia.

[Project 4: Association Rule Mining, Tools: Python](https://github.com/FarihaAnis/Portfolio/blob/main/Association%20Rule%20Mining.ipynb)

This project analyzes Dataset A, containing daily store transactions including member numbers, dates, and items purchased. After thorough exploration and preparation for association rule mining, key insights like top-selling items and transaction trends are revealed. Leveraging the Apriori algorithm, association rules are generated based on frequent itemsets, with recommendations provided to optimize sales and customer satisfaction by strategically positioning related items within the store layout.

[Project 5: Clustering Analysis using K-Means, Tools: Python](https://github.com/FarihaAnis/Portfolio/blob/main/Clustering%20Analysis%20using%20K-Means.ipynb)

This project presents a concise exploration of clustering analysis using the K-Means algorithm. It covers the essential steps from data preparation, including normalization and exploratory data analysis (EDA), to visualizing text data frequencies. The focus is on applying K-Means to identify meaningful patterns and clusters within the dataset, showcasing the algorithm's effectiveness in revealing insights from data.

[Project 6: Sales and Inventory Management System Analysis, Tools: SQL]
[Database Setup]
[Analysis]

This SQL project lays the groundwork for a sales_inventory database, setting up tables for customers, employees, offices, orders, product lines, and products, enriched with sample data and interconnected through foreign key constraints. It leverages SQL queries for in-depth analysis of sales and inventory management, including employee distribution, customer credit limits, sales performance, product profitability, and inventory levels. This foundation supports critical insights into operational trends and strategic decision-making within the sales inventory management system.
